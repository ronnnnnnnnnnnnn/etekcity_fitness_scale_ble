# Etekcity Fitness Scale BLE Integration for Home Assistant

This custom integration allows you to connect your Etekcity Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) fitness scale to Home Assistant. It provides real-time weight measurements and body composition metrics directly in your Home Assistant instance, without requiring an internet connection or the VeSync app.
